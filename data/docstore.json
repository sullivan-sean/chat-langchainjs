{"0":{"pageContent":"Welcome to LangChain#\nLarge language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling\ndevelopers to build applications that they previously could not.\nBut using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to\ncreate a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to\ncombine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.\nThis library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these types of applications include:\n❓ Question Answering over specific documents\nDocumentation\nEnd-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\n💬 Chatbots\nDocumentation\nEnd-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain\n🤖 Agents\nDocumentation\nEnd-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\nGetting Started#\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\nGetting Started Documentation\nModules#\nThere are six main modules that LangChain provides support for.","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"}},"1":{"pageContent":"Getting Started Documentation\nModules#\nThere are six main modules that LangChain provides support for.\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\nLLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\nDocument Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\nUtils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"}},"2":{"pageContent":"Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\nUse Cases#\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways.

Most of them are focused on end-to-end methods that optimize the fetching of the relevant data as well as passing it in as context.

Other methods to fetch relevant data could involve hitting an API, querying a database, or just working with user provided data (eg a specific document that they want to summarize).\nLet’s now deep dive on the two steps involved: fetching and augmenting.\nFetching#\nThere are many ways to fetch relevant data to pass in as context to a LM, and these methods largely depend\non the use case.\nUser provided: In some cases, the user may provide the relevant data, and no algorithm for fetching is needed.\nAn example of this is for summarization of specific documents: the user will provide the document to be summarized,","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/combine_docs.html"}},"38":{"pageContent":"An example of this is for summarization of specific documents: the user will provide the document to be summarized,\nand task the language model with summarizing it.\nDocument Retrieval: One of the more common use cases involves fetching relevant documents or pieces of text from\na large corpus of data.

One example of this is WebGPT like system,\nwhere you first query Google (or another search API) for relevant information, and then those results are used in\nthe generation step. Another example could be querying a structured database (like SQL) and then using a language model\nto synthesize those results.\nThere are two big issues to deal with in fetching:\nFetching small enough pieces of information\nNot fetching too many pieces of information (e.g. fetching only the most relevant pieces)\nText Splitting#","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/combine_docs.html"}},"39":{"pageContent":"There are two big issues to deal with in fetching:\nFetching small enough pieces of information\nNot fetching too many pieces of information (e.g. fetching only the most relevant pieces)\nText Splitting#\nOne big issue with all of these methods is how to make sure you are working with pieces of text that are not too large.\nThis is important because most language models have a context length, and so you cannot (yet) just pass a\nlarge document in as context. Therefore, it is important to not only fetch relevant data but also make sure it is in\nsmall enough chunks.\nLangChain provides some utilities to help with splitting up larger pieces of data. This comes in the form of the TextSplitter class.\nThe class takes in a document and splits it up into chunks, with several parameters that control the\nsize of the chunks as well as the overlap in the chunks (important for maintaining context).\nSee this walkthrough for more information.\nRelevant Documents#","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/combine_docs.html"}},"40":{"pageContent":"size of the chunks as well as the overlap in the chunks (important for maintaining context).\nSee this walkthrough for more information.\nRelevant Documents#\nA second large issue related fetching data is to make sure you are not fetching too many documents, and are only fetching\nthe documents that are relevant to the query/question at hand. There are a few ways to deal with this.\nOne concrete example of this is vector stores for document retrieval, often used for semantic search or question answering.\nWith this method, larger documents are split up into\nsmaller chunks and then each chunk of text is passed to an embedding function which creates an embedding for that piece of text.\nThose are embeddings are then stored in a database. When a new search query or question comes in, an embedding is\ncreated for that query/question and then documents with embeddings most similar to that embedding are fetched.\nExamples of vector database companies include Pinecone and Weaviate.","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/combine_docs.html"}},"41":{"pageContent":"created for that query/question and then documents with embeddings most similar to that embedding are fetched.\nExamples of vector database companies include Pinecone and Weaviate.\nAlthough this is perhaps the most common way of document retrieval, people are starting to think about alternative\ndata structures and indexing techniques specifically for working with language models.

For this notebook, it is important to understand the distinction we draw between agents and tools. An agent is the LLM powered decision maker that decides which actions to take and in which order. Tools are various instruments (functions) an agent has access to, through which an agent can interact with the outside world. When people generally use agents, they primarily talk about using an agent WITH tools. However, when we talk about serialization of agents, we are talking about the agent by itself. We plan to add support for serializing an agent WITH tools sometime in the future.\nLet’s start by creating an agent with tools as we normally do:\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=\"zero-shot-react-description\", verbose=True)","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/agents/examples/serialization.html"}},"240":{"pageContent":"from langchain.llms import OpenAI\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=\"zero-shot-react-description\", verbose=True)\nLet’s now serialize the agent.

So if that step requires multiple inputs, they need to be parsed from that. Therefor, the currently supported way to do this is write a smaller wrapper function that parses that a string into multiple inputs.\nFor a concrete example, let’s work on giving an agent access to a multiplication function, which takes as input two integers. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the “Action Input” as a comma separated list of length two. We will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function.\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/agents/examples/multi_input_tool.html"}},"244":{"pageContent":"from langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool\nHere is the multiplication function, as well as a wrapper to parse a string as input.\ndef multiplier(a, b):\n    return a * b\ndef parsing_multiplier(string):\n    a, b = string.split(\",\")\n    return multiplier(int(a), int(b))\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\ntools = [\n    Tool(\n        name = \"Multiplier\",\n        func=parsing_multiplier,\n        description=\"useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together.

It is a string of text that is used to generate a response from the language model.\nPrompt Templates#\nPromptTemplates are a way to create prompts in a reproducible way. They contain a template string, and a set of input variables. The template string can be formatted with the input variables to generate a prompt. The template string often contains instructions to the language model, a few shot examples, and a question to the language model.\nPromptTemplates generically have a format method that takes in variables and returns a formatted string.\nThe most simple implementation of this is to have a template string with some variables in it, and then format it with the incoming variables.\nMore complex iterations dynamically construct the template string from few shot examples, etc.\nTo learn more about PromptTemplates, see Prompt Templates.\nAs an example, consider the following template string:\n\"\"\"\nPredict the capital of a country.","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/prompts/key_concepts.html"}},"422":{"pageContent":"To learn more about PromptTemplates, see Prompt Templates.\nAs an example, consider the following template string:\n\"\"\"\nPredict the capital of a country.\nCountry: {country}\nCapital:\n\"\"\"\nInput Variables#\nInput variables are the variables that are used to fill in the template string. In the example above, the input variable is country.\nGiven an input variable, the PromptTemplate can generate a prompt by filling in the template string with the input variable. For example, if the input variable is United States, the template string can be formatted to generate the following prompt:\n\"\"\"\nPredict the capital of a country.\nCountry: United States\nCapital:\n\"\"\"\nFew Shot Examples#\nFew shot examples refer to in-context examples that are provided to a language model as part of a prompt. The examples can be used to help the language model understand the context of the prompt, and as a result generate a better response.

Generally, the quality of the response from the LLM can be significantly improved by selecting the most relevant examples. This is because the language model will be able to better understand the context of the prompt, and also potentially learn failure modes to avoid.","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/prompts/key_concepts.html"}},"424":{"pageContent":"To help the user with selecting the most relevant examples, we provide example selectors that select the most relevant based on different criteria, such as length, semantic similarity, etc. The example selector takes in a list of examples and returns a list of selected examples, formatted as a string. The user can also provide their own example selector. To learn more about example selectors, see Example Selection.\nSerialization#\nTo make it easy to share PromptTemplates, we provide a serialize method that returns a JSON string. The JSON string can be saved to a file, and then loaded back into a PromptTemplate using the deserialize method.

By the Cayley proposition H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) ≃ H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) and by the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem for projective\\n\\ntoric orbifolds there is a non-zero algebraic basis λ C 1 , . . . , λ C n with rational coeﬃcients of H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) , that is, there are n ∶ = h 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) algebraic curves C 1 , . . . , C n in X such that under the Poincar´e duality the class in homology [ C i ] goes to λ C i , [ C i ] ↦ λ C i .

Recall that the Cox ring of P k + 2 is contained in the Cox ring of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X without considering the grading. Considering the grading we have that if α ∈ Cl ( P k + 2 Σ ) then ( α, 0 ) ∈ Cl ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ) . So the polynomials deﬁning C i ⊂ P k + 2 Σ can be interpreted in P 2 k + 1 X, Σ but with diﬀerent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each C i is contained in Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } and\\n\\nfurthermore it has codimension k .\\n\\nClaim: { C i } ni = 1 is a basis of prim ( ) . It is enough to prove that λ C i is diﬀerent from zero in H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) or equivalently that the cohomology classes { λ C i } ni = 1 do not come from the ambient space. By contradiction, let us assume that there exists a j and C ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that λ C ∈ H k,k ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X , Q ) with i ∗ ( λ C ) = λ C j or in terms of homology there exists a ( k + 2 ) -dimensional algebraic subvariety V ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that V ∩ Y = C j so they are equal as a homology class of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ,i.e., [ V ∩ Y ] = [ C j ] . It is easy to check that π ( V ) ∩ X = C j as a subvariety of P k + 2 Σ where π ∶ ( x, y ) ↦ x . Hence [ π ( V ) ∩ X ] = [ C j ] which is equivalent to say that λ C j comes from P k + 2 Σ which","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/document_loaders/examples/online_pdf.html"}},"728":{"pageContent":"such that V ∩ Y = C j so they are equal as a homology class of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ,i.e., [ V ∩ Y ] = [ C j ] .

Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key fact was that on X the Hodge conjecture holds and we translate it to Y by contradiction. So, using an analogous argument we have:\\n\\nargument we have:\\n\\nProposition 5.3.

This interface operates over a list of strings because often the lists of strings can be batched to the LLM provider,\nproviding speed and efficiency gains.\nFor convenience, this class also exposes a simpler, more user friendly interface (via __call__).\nThe interface for this takes in a single string, and returns a single string.\nGeneration#\nThe output of a single generation.

This can be used to set any number of environment variables before running a command. For example, if we wanted to set the environment variable `VAR` to `hello` before running a Deno command, we could do so like this:\\n\\n```\\nVAR=hello deno run main.ts\\n```\\n\\nThis will set the environment variable `VAR` to `hello` before running the command.

you a quick walkthrough about building an end-to-end language model application with LangChain.\nInstallation#\nTo get started, install LangChain with the following command:\npip install langchain\nEnvironment Setup#\nUsing LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, apis, etc.\nFor this example, we will be using OpenAI’s APIs, so we will first need to install their SDK:\npip install openai\nWe will then need to set the environment variable in the terminal.\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\"\nAlternatively, you could do this from inside

Model Application#\nNow that we have installed LangChain and set up our environment, we can start building our language model application.\nLangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language model applications. Modules can be combined to create more complex applications, or be used individually for simple applications.\nLLMs: Get predictions from a language model\nThe most basic building block of LangChain is calling an LLM on some input.\nLet’s walk through a simple example of how to do this.\nFor this purpose, let’s pretend we are building a service that generates a company name based on what the company makes.\nIn order to do this, we first need to import the LLM wrapper.\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nWe can then initialize the wrapper with any arguments.\nIn this example, we probably want the outputs to be MORE random, so we’ll initialize it with a HIGH temperature.\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html"}},"1228":{"pageContent":"We can then initialize the wrapper with any arguments.\nIn this example, we probably want the outputs to be MORE random, so we’ll initialize it with a HIGH temperature.\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)\nWe can now call it on some input!\ntext = \"What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks?\"\nprint(llm(text))\nFeetful of Fun\nFor more details on how to use LLMs within LangChain, see the LLM getting started guide.\nPrompt Templates: Manage prompts for LLMs\nCalling an LLM is a great first step, but it’s just the beginning.\nNormally when you use an LLM in an application, you are not sending user input directly to the LLM.\nInstead, you are probably taking user input and constructing a prompt, and then sending that to the LLM.\nFor example, in the previous example, the text we passed in was hardcoded to ask for a name for a company that made colorful socks.","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html"}},"1229":{"pageContent":"For example, in the previous example, the text we passed in was hardcoded to ask for a name for a company that made colorful socks.\nIn this imaginary service, what we would want to do is take only the user input describing what the company does, and then format the prompt with that information.\nThis is easy to do with LangChain!\nFirst lets define the prompt template:\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"product\"],\n    template=\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\",\n)\nLet’s now see how this works! We can call the .format method to format it.\nprint(prompt.format(product=\"colorful socks\"))\nWhat is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?\nFor more details, check out the getting started guide for prompts.\nChains: Combine LLMs and prompts in multi-step workflows","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html"}},"1230":{"pageContent":"What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?\nFor more details, check out the getting started guide for prompts.\nChains: Combine LLMs and prompts in multi-step workflows\nUp until now, we’ve worked with the PromptTemplate and LLM primitives by themselves. But of course, a real application is not just one primitive, but rather a combination of them.\nA chain in LangChain is made up of links, which can be either primitives like LLMs or other chains.\nThe most core type of chain is an LLMChain, which consists of a PromptTemplate and an LLM.\nExtending the previous example, we can construct an LLMChain which takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM.\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"product\"],\n    template=\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\",\n)","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html"}},"1231":{"pageContent":"from langchain.llms import OpenAI\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"product\"],\n    template=\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\",\n)\nWe can now create a very simple chain that will take user input, format the prompt with it, and then send it to the LLM:\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nchain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\nNow we can run that chain only specifying the product!\nchain.run(\"colorful socks\")\n# -> '\\n\\nSocktastic!'\nThere we go! There’s the first chain - an LLM Chain.\nThis is one of the simpler types of chains, but understanding how it works will set you up well for working with more complex chains.\nFor more details, check out the getting started guide for chains.\nAgents: Dynamically call chains based on user input\nSo far the chains we’ve looked at run in a predetermined order.","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html"}},"1232":{"pageContent":"For more details, check out the getting started guide for chains.\nAgents: Dynamically call chains based on user input\nSo far the chains we’ve looked at run in a predetermined order.\nAgents no longer do: they use an LLM to determine which actions to take and in what order. An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning to the user.\nWhen used correctly agents can be extremely powerful. In this tutorial, we show you how to easily use agents through the simplest, highest level API.\nIn order to load agents, you should understand the following concepts:\nTool: A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL, other chains. The interface for a tool is currently a function that is expected to have a string as an input, with a string as an output.\nLLM: The language model powering the agent.","metadata":{"source":"langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html"}},"1233":{"pageContent":"LLM: The language model powering the agent.\nAgent: The agent to use.

But often, you may want a chain or agent to have some concept of “memory” so that it may remember information about its previous interactions. The clearest and simple example of this is when designing a chatbot - you want it to remember previous messages so it can use context from that to have a better conversation. This would be a type of “short-term memory”. On the more complex side, you could imagine a chain/agent remembering key pieces of information over time - this would be a form of “long-term memory”.
